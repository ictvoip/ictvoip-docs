Autobill Debug
****************

When you enable CDR Autobill Debug you will be presented with an output of the CDR billing collection from manually running the autobill.  You may test run your install by populating the script link into your browser. Be sure to set the next due date of the clientâ€™s VoIP product to be the current date.

When executed debug will display the calculations from the CDR billing once it has complete. 

.. Warning ::  Note that when running CRON via the browser it's processing can be very slow, be patient.

Filtering
***********

Here we can filter CDR information for a particular Provider. When selecting the provider from the ictVoIP Billing Dashboard you are presented with the Billing Management Dashboard. 

Exclude/Suppress
##################

Exclude and Suppress CDR output from columns Direction & Description. 

::

 Exclude = exclude these filtered CDR records from billing
 Suppress = Suppress the CDR record from displaying in the CDR Client View

|
Here we can elimante the CDR output of internal calls such as direct Extension or Voicemail calling by adding filter phares like this:

Let's exclude all extension calls within a tenant or domain list.

Exclude/Supress dialed codes starting with *xx and #xx, might be *97, *71, *72 etc.
::

 *xx, #xx, 4443, 4747
